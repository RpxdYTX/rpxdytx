### Rafael, a 13 years old brazillian
 Hi, i am Rafael, a 13 year old guy, from brazil,
 i mainly code and study, but without the study
 part.<br/>I decided to code when i was 11, mostly
 because my goal was to make a game with my own
 imagination, i really like**d** games **that
 time**, i don't like it as much as before
 anymore, because, most of the time i do what i
 most like, code.
### But why code?
 As i was saying, i was trying to make a game,
 that would finally be good at my eyes (not
 saying that the games i played were bad, they
 just wasn't enough), that would be perfect.<br/>
 Then i faced one challenge, coding, i just
 googled my question which was: "*how to make
 a game?*", a quick solution i found was Unity,
 After it, somehow (i still don't remember how,
 even though it was 2 years ago, no so long) i
 "*learned*" what is a programming language and
 i googled: "*what programming language i need
 to use Unity?*", then, where it all started, a
 solution appeared and i saw it, "_**C#**_"(C
 Sharp), this is where it **all** began (i mean
 not really much, but you got the point).
